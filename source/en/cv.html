                        I'm a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> and
                        a <strong>programming instructor</strong>. I like to be surrounded by
                        people who push me to do the best work of my career as well as people I can
                        nurture and support.

                        and the United States and I’m looking forward to be part of a team that
                        values work-life balance, TDD, pair programming and code reviews.

                        <strong>Web developer and Instructor</strong>.
                        <p>
                            I am currently working in SA. TX. as a web developer and instructor teaching
                            <strong>Java (Spring Boot)</strong> to entry-level full-stack developers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an instructor I introduce students to the practices and values to
                            work effectively in teams, in order to present their first software product
                            after 18 weeks of intensive training in Web development
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My main contributions so far include: 1) The introduction of pair programming to solve
                            medium/large exercises. 2) A change in the way we teach Git and Github which is now
                            something we deliver incrementally since day one. 3) Students now have the chance
                            to learn how to use Github issues and Pull Requests during their first project in teams.
                            4) I also introduced a shorter feedback loop process during their final projects, which
                            is a 2 week period, by implementing daily demos.
                            I also review their code during that period.
                            These changes have improved the experience and the results achieved by our students.
